This project is the Virtual Pets projects. You will be able to create a Pet and allow it to do the following:

You can give them a name

They can get older

As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit

You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness. 

You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger. 

You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking

If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 

If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE
